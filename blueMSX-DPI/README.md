# BlueMSX DPI

Based on BlueMSX v. 2.9 by Daniel Vik and many, many other people.

Features:
* DPI awareness binary, so it renders correctly on high dpi settings
* Solution for Visual Studio 2017 (the folder says VS2012, maybe it still works on it, but I compiled it on 2017)
* 300% zoom option for window mode, working on GDI, Direct-X, Direct-X HW and Direct3D.

## BEWARE:
- Only the classic theme will work with this version. I have no clue how other themes will behave.
- Do not install this over a previous BlueMSX installation. Weird things might happen.

## This is experimental, use it at your own risk!
