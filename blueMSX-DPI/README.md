# BlueMSX DPI

Based on [BlueMSX v. 2.9 by Daniel Vik](https://github.com/svn2github/blueMSX) and many, many other people.

Features:
* DPI awareness binary, so it renders correctly on high dpi settings
* Solution for Visual Studio 2017 (the folder says VS2012, maybe it still works on it, but I compiled it on 2017)
* 300% zoom option for window mode, working on GDI, Direct-X, Direct-X HW and Direct3D.
* Fix to load Back to the Future MSX2

## BEWARE:
- Only the classic theme will work with this version. I have no clue how other themes will behave.
- Do not install this over a previous BlueMSX installation. Weird things might happen.

## This is experimental, use it at your own risk!

## Direct-X 9
If you don't have Direct-X 9 or you get a "missing D3DX9_42.DLL" error, download the Direct-X web setup from here: [Direct-X 9 Web Setup](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=35)
BE CAREFUL WHEN INSTALLING THIS, IT WILL ASK TO INSTALL THE "BING BAR" - just untick that checkbox and you'll should be good to go.
